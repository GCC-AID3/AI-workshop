# Welcome to the Machine Learning and AI in Biomedical Research Resource Page!

## Introduction
This page is a treasure trove of educational materials compiled from a series of lectures and discussions delivered by GCC AI workgroup leaders. It is designed to enlighten and guide enthusiasts and professionals alike through the fascinating world of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as applied in the realm of biomedical research.

Here, you will find an array of slide decks that first lay the foundation by covering the basics of ML/AI. These presentations are not just slides; they are interactive resources with embedded hyperlinks and interactive features that allow knowledge seekers to explore deeper and find real-world use cases with coding examples (not by us). As you delve deeper, you will discover how large language models, the emerging titan of the AI domain, have already revolutionized biomedical research. Their ability to parse, understand, and generate human-like text is not just a parlor trick but can be extended beyond conventional linguistics and is a powerful tool in the hands of scientists.

The integration of ML/AI technologies in drug discovery research is nothing short of a paradigm shift. These technologies have been instrumental in identifying novel drug candidates, understanding disease mechanisms, and predicting drug outcomes, thereby accelerating the pace at which new treatments reach those in need.

To aid in the practical application of these technologies, we have also included a comprehensive list of both hardware and software resources. We view this as an important consideration in adopting these technologies, which will be the future building blocks that enable researchers in academic environments to harness the power of ML/AI for drug discovery.

We invite you to explore, learn, and contribute to this growing field. Any bias is strictly unintentional, and we would love to hear feedback on ways this resource could be amended or improved upon. Every bit of knowledge has the potential to lead to groundbreaking discoveries in healthcare. 

Welcome, and let the journey begin!
